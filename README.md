# Hacksaw 1.1.2

A simple text truncation plugin for [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com/). This plugin adds a [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) filter to take your entry's content and hack it down to a more manageable size. It strips the HTML and limits the excerpts by character count, word count, or cutoff marker.

## Installation

1. Move `hacksaw` directory to `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install **Hacksaw** under **Craft Admin &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Plugins**

## Parameters

There are several parameters you can use to control how the content is truncated. These options are:

| Parameter			| Type		| Default	| Description														|
| -----------------	| :-------:	| :-------:	| -----------------------------------------------------------------	|
| chars 			| int		| `null`	| Limit by number of characters (**Note:** includes chars of HTML)	|
| chars_start		| int		| 0			| Starting point for chars limit (used with chars param)			|
| words				| int		| `null`	| Limit by number of words											|
| cutoff			| string	| `null`	| Limit by a specific cutoff string									|
| append			| string	| `null`	| String to append to the end of the excerpt						|
| allow				| string	| `null`	| HTML tags you want to allow										|

## Usage

For example, if you want to limit your excerpt to 100 words you would do this:

```
{{ entry.richTextField|hacksaw(words='100') }}
```
By default Hacksaw will strip all HTML from your excerpt. If you would like to keep some basic HTML you can use the `allow` parameter to keep specific HTML tags. For example, let's say you want to keep `<p>` and `<b>` tags:

```
{{ entry.richTextField|hacksaw(words='100', allow='<p><b>') }}
```

Another way to limit content is by a cutoff string. This is similar to the way WordPress's *more* feature works. In your content you could add a specific string to indicate the spot you want the excerpt to stop. Let's say you use, `<!-- END -->`; to cut the excerpt off at this location you would do this:

```
{{ entry.richTextField|hacksaw(cutoff='<!-- END -->') }}
```

The `cutoff` parameter can be coupled with the `words` parameter in case you forget to add the cutoff string to some of your entries. This way the excerpt will be truncated at the cutoff string, **OR** after *X* words.

You can add any string at the end of the excerpt using the `append` parameter, like this:

```
{{ entry.richTextField|hacksaw(words='100', append='...') }}
```

This would append "..." to the end of the excerpt.

**Note:** If you are including HTML in the append parameter, the elements must be present in the `allow` paramenter. If you are including a Craft variable in any parameter, it must be added using the Twig concatenation operator, `~`. Example of both:

```
{{ entry.richTextField|hacksaw(words='100', allow='<a>', append='<a href="' ~ entry.url ~ '">Continue...</a>') }}
```

## Roadmap
- Add truncation by number of paragraphs
